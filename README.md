# Project-On-Student-Management-System
🎓 Student Management System
A Java-based console application for managing student records with a simple and intuitive interface. This project demonstrates core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, and data persistence using serialization.

🚀 Features
Add new student records (ID, Name, Marks)

View all stored student records

Search for a student by ID

Persistent storage using students.dat file (via object serialization)

Console-based interaction using Java’s Scanner class

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (Core)

File I/O (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)

Object Serialization

Collections (ArrayList)

📂 How It Works
The system maintains a list of student objects, saves them to a .dat file, and retrieves them across sessions using Java serialization. It provides a command-line interface to interact with the stored data efficiently.
